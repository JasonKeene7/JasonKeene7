# Familliar Programming Laguages
> C++
  The language I am currently most familliar (and currently working) with. I am very comfortable with classes, vectors, and using pointers to pass around parameters.
  
  - Arduino
  Current and most familliar robotics platform. Recently experimenting with using the ATMega ICs in custom circuit boards to reduce footprint size and create a more professional looking final project.
  
  - Propeller C
  My first C based microcontroller from Parallax Inc.; likely has the largest collection of completed projects (albeit small ones) as of August 2022. It has 8-cores to multithread with, but I didn't experiment with that too much outside the tutorials.
  
- BASIC 
  My first introduction to coding and microcontrollers with a kit from Parallax Inc.. Think that was in 2015...
  
- HTML
  Introduced to HTML programming from the Propeller's Wifi module/tutorial, was having a hard time understanding what the webpage did so I took a summer learning the basics from W3Schools.
  I have three major projects written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: 
  First one is a joystick -- in the loosest sense -- the ball position can be updated by moving some sliders or entering XY-coordinates manually. 
  The second is a 0-1 logic analyser, using the canvas, timer functionality, and a bit of JQuery, where you can create and assign state changes to named lines with options to add signal propegation delay; change line color to represent HIGH or LOW signals with the option to both pick the colors and to add hysterisis; there's also functionality for adding logic lines, only added AND and OR gates, only the AND is glitchless (for all I know). This project is also what first prompted me to carefully scan a code library, needed *eval()* to change the website layout with JS.
  My 2020 capstone project used a webpage to both display and send commands to a rover, which worked for the most part. Forgot to reopen threads for the Arduino Ethernet Sheild, think that's what caused the robot to spazz out every so often, think I had to reset the entire program ocasionally too...
  
- CSS
  Natural progression from HTML, figured it more useful for website styling for keeping most settings in a single file. Took a month or two learning CSS after going through the HTML tutorial.
  
> JavaScript
  Again, natural leadup from HTML, thook a few months learning that too. Thinking back, 
  - Node JS
