# Electronics
  My introduction to circuitry belongs to the BASIC microcontroller kit I played with in 2015, the included book containing the very basics in coding and electronics; Ohm's Law, how to read a resistor, polarity of various small components, and an introduction to ICs. Think it was a year later when I got the Propeller C robotics kit; breif taste in C programming (little did I know), came with a handful of more complex devices, first platform that could drive around an area too -- though nothing too sophisticated given the kit contents.
  Then I got formal instructions at Dutchess Community College in 2018, first semester was mostly review, though that was also when I was introduced to the Arduino platform and the wide-wide world of ICs come Digital Circuits class 2nd semester. Would need to look this up, pretty sure by summer I began actively ordering parts to experiment with at home.

## PCB Drawing

# Familliar Programming Laguages
> C++
  The language I am currently most familliar (and currently working) with. I am very comfortable with classes, vectors, and using pointers to pass around parameters.
  
  - Arduino
  Current and most familliar robotics platform. Recently experimenting with using the ATMega ICs in custom circuit boards to reduce footprint size and create a more professional looking final project.
  
  - Propeller C
  My first C based microcontroller from Parallax Inc.; likely has the largest collection of completed projects (albeit small ones) as of August 2022. It has 8-cores to multithread with, but I didn't experiment with that too much outside the tutorials.
  
- BASIC 
  My first introduction to coding and microcontrollers with a kit from Parallax Inc.
  
- HTML
  Introduced to HTML programming from the Propeller's Wifi module/tutorial, was having a hard time understanding what the webpage did so I took a summer learning the basics from W3Schools.
  I have three major projects written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: 
  First one is a joystick -- in the loosest sense -- the ball position can be updated by moving some sliders or entering XY-coordinates manually. 
  The second is a 0-1 logic analyser, using the canvas, timer functionality, and a bit of JQuery, where you can create and assign state changes to named lines with options to add signal propegation delay; change line color to represent HIGH or LOW signals with the option to both pick the colors and to add hysterisis; there's also functionality for adding logic lines, only added AND and OR gates, only the AND is glitchless (for all I know). This project is also what first prompted me to carefully scan a code library, needed *eval()* to change the website layout with JS.
  My 2020 Capstone Project used a webpage to both display and send commands to a rover, which worked for the most part. Forgot to reopen threads for the Arduino Ethernet Sheild, think that's what caused the robot to spazz out every so often, think I had to reset the entire program ocasionally too...
  
- CSS
  Natural progression from HTML, figured it more useful for website styling for keeping most settings in a single file. Took a month or two learning CSS after going through the HTML tutorial.
  
> JavaScript
  Again, natural leadup from HTML, thook a few months learning that too. 
  Thinking back, I tended to split my JS files based on functionality as if I was coding classes, long before I had any clue of C++ -- good on me I guess.
  
  - Node JS
  My first exposure to server-side programming, did not go very deep as I only needed it for my 2020 Capstone Project as an inbetween for my Arduino and webpage. Took *4-weeks* to even become aware of the terms server-side and client-side programming.
